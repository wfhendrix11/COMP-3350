COMP 3350 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language

Projects from my COMP 3350 class. All Programs are using the x86 Instruction Set Architecture. Many of the programs have a dependency 
an "Irvine32" library, this can be found here: http://kipirvine.com/asm/gettingstartedvs2015/index.htm 
The programs were created in Visual Studio using the MASM Assembler.
